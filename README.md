# Target-tracking-using-particle-filter

Particle Filter Algorithm is a nonparametric implementation of the Bayes Filter to approximate state. 

The idea is to represent the posterior belief by a finite number of random variables (particles). The algorithm repeatedly resamples the particles based on likelihood derived from a measurement model to track objects.
